## graphplotter

A basic graph plotter developed in the QT development environment. 

Written using C++. 

This is a basic graph plotter which takes in values of 'X' and 'Y' and plots a basic graph. The data is contained in a text file containing 2 columns corresponding to the values of X and Y separated by blank space.
Drag and drop the text file in the application window to plot the graph.

Two additional features are added for styling- Graph line thickness and color.

Runs perfectly in QT Creator IDE.
